### Problem C - Simplification of Java Classes
3 Java classes (JAddress, JCompany, and jPerson) have been created in dojo.leeds.problem3.
Convert these classes to Kotlin data classes to see how much boilerplate code can be removed.
Remember that Kotlin allows multiple classes to be defined in a single file.

  - Count the number of pupils in the file.
  - Count the number of unique pupil names.
  - How many pupils are there in each class?
  - Which
  - Which class has the highest average score per pupil?
  - Which students were awarded 3 grade 'A's?
  - Which students were awarded at least a 'C' in all subjects?
